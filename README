Plaphoons for Android is a talker app for Android tablets. 

The talker apps helps people with speech disorder to communicate in basic sentences. It allows users to tap on a pictogram on their tablet and let the tablet speak out the associated word.
There are plenty of different free and commercial version for the desktop but we could not find anything for Android tablets.

The app is based on the Plaphoons application for PCs that was developed by the Fressa project (http://www.xtec.cat/~jlagares/f2kesp.htm).  The Android application is based on the Java version of Plaphoons and optimized for tablets. 

If you don't have a .pla file ready you can use the inlcuded SampleTalkCollection for demos.
